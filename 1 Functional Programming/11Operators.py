# IN PYTHON WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOTAL FIVE OPERATORS-
# 1. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
# 2. RELATIONAL OPERATORS
# 3. LOGICAL OPERATORS
# 4. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS       IT IS JUST FOR ASSIGNING VALUES TO VARIABLES.
# 5. UNARY OPERATORS

# print("ADDITION IS = ", x+y)
# print("SUBTRACTION IS = ", x-y)
# print("MULTIPLICATION IS = ",x*y)
# print("DIVISION IS = ", x/y)
# print("REMAINDER IS = ", x%y)

# print("RELATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE : ")
# if(x > y): print("X IS BIGGER")
# if(x >= y): print("X IS GREATER THAN EQUAL TO Y")
